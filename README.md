## üöÄ Usage

### Web UI

-
   - **Allowlist Management**: Filter items by seller's country

### Telegram Commands

After configuring your Telegram bot in the Web UI, you can use the following commands:

- `/add_query query` - Add a search query to monitor
- `/remove_query query_number` - Remove a specific query
- `/remove_query all` - Remove all queries
- `/queries` - List all active queries
- `/hello` - Check if the bot is working
- `/create_allowlist` - Create a country allowlist (will slow down processing)
- `/delete_allowlist` - Delete the country allowlist
- `/add_country XX` - Add a country to the allowlist (ISO3166 format)
- `/remove_country XX` - Remove a country from the allowlist
- `/allowlist` - View the current allowlist

### Query Examples

Queries must be added with a whole link. It works with filters.:

   ```

```
